						<h4>Summary</h4>
						<p align="justify">
							During this training unit, we dealt with notions related to networks that are linked with wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT networks.<br>
							We could see the protocols used in this type of network, and the different evolutions of the mobile network generations. We were also able to approach the principle of Software Defined Networks.<br>
							In addition, we had to make reports and presentations on different topics, and did practical work to apply the principles we had seen. We also discussed the security aspects related to these wireless networks.

				<h2>Protocols for Wireless Sensor Network</h2>

				<p align="justify">
					This course introduce us to <b>protocols</b> and <b>standards</b> used in <b>Wireless Sensor Network</b>. The goal was to compare these by different important <b>metrics</b> like <b>cost</b>, <b>energy-efficiency</b>, <b>robustness</b>, etc.<br>
					We've seen how these protocols were defined and why they choose to focus on this metric instead of another for a given protocol. We've also seen the <b>evolution</b> of the protocols, related to the evolution of <b>technologies</b> used.<br>
					We had to realized 2 works, first one in group of 4 students on a Protocol used in WSN, our subject was on <b>LoRa</b> protocol.<br>
					The second work was a study about <b>MAC protocols</b> used in Wireless Sensor Network. This was hardest due to the large variety of existing protocol and the information concerning all useful metrics that are sometimes hard to find on <b>scientific literature</b>.<br>
					We had to present our work to the class both times.<br>

				<h2>From 3G to 5G</h2>

				<p align="justify">
					This course introduced us to the different generations of <b>mobile networks</b>, from <b>3G</b> to the <b>5G</b> currently being deployed. We were able to explore the different <b>innovations</b> of each generation and what it has enabled us to develop in terms of <b>technology</b>.<br>
					We had, in pairs, to prepare a presentation around the theme of 5G, we chose to present with my pair the <b>health risks</b> related to <b>electromagnetic waves</b> (and particularly 5G).<br>
					<br>
					The presentation slides are available below:<br>

				<h2>Energy for connected objects</h2>

				<p align="justify">
					During this course, we were introduced to the different <b>technologies</b> and methods to make connected objects '<b>autonomous</b>' in <b>energy</b>. Since connected objects are often not connected to an electrical network, we were introduced to the different types of <b>batteries</b> available or the means of <b>self-powering</b>.
					We did not do any personal work in connection with this course, as it was evaluated during a written exam.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
				<p align="justify">
					These courses allowed me to deepen my theoretical and practical skills on points that we had already been able to address in previous years at INSA, such as virtual machines and virtualization. On top of that, I was able to develop other skills, especially those related to service-oriented architectures and the web (with REST API), skills that I didn't have before these modules. The Middleware part also allowed me to realize the application of these technologies in a context related to the Internet of Things, with different protocols, types of connected objects, and interfacing tools. I was also able to learn skills not related to the technologies used for development, such as continuous integration with Jenkis or project organization with the Scrum method, which is in my opinion something very important for a computer scientist.
